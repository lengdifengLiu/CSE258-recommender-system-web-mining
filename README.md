# CSE258-recommender-system-web-mining

I'm uploading the first three homework assignments, the midterm exam questions, and the codes, assignment1 and assignment2. It's worth noting that these are not entirely correct (I only got a perfect score on gradscope), and some of them are even not very logical (since I may finish an assignment several days apart, there are some inconsistencies); but I still hope that they can give others some hints. I still hope that they can give some hints to other people.
