The Jaccard similarity is used to calculate the similarity between items, and exponential decay is employed to assign a time weight to each similarity (with a chosen lambda of 0.001). The predicted rating is based on the average rating of the item, the similarity between items, and the aforementioned time decay factor.', 1.6993689339769356]}
